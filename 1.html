  Units of Energy & Math Conversions
<br><h3> Conversions </h3>
<br><h3> Laws of Thermodynamics </h3>
<ul>
 <li> First Law of Thermodynamics </li>
 - Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred and transformed.<br>
 - Ex: In photosynthesis, radiant energy from the Sun is converted to chemical energy in the form of the bonds that hold together atoms in carbohydrates.<br>
 <li> Second Law of Thermodynamics </li>
 - This law says that the entropy (disorder) of the universe is increasing. <br>
 - In most energy transformations, a significant fraction of the energy is lost to the universe as heat.<br>
 - Ex: In food chains only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is available for the next energy level upon consumption.
