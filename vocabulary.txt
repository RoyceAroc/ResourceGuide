Vocabulary
1. Energy
   - Capacity to Do Work
   
2. Potential Energy 
   - Energy at rest (stored energy)
   
3. Kinetic Energy 
   - Energy in motion
   
4. Radiant Energy
   - Sunlight  
   - Form of energy than can travel through empty space.
   
5. Convection  
   - Transfer of heat by the movement of energy around Earth (describes the movement of energy around Earth).
   
6. Conduction  
   - Transfer of energy through matter from particle to particle (describes the movement of energy around Earth).
   
7. Energy Quality 
   - High quality energy means electrical energy, mechanical energy, and some forms of chemical stored energy, for example, the fossil fuels. Low quality energy means low temperature heat. High quality energy is more valuable than low quality energy. As such, coal produces more energy than wood. 
   
8. Net Energy Yield
   - It refers to the comparison between the cost of extraction, processing, transportation, and the amount of useful energy derived from the fuel. 
   - Amount of energy available from a resource - amount of energy needed to make it available. 

9. First Law of Thermodynamics 
   - Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.

10. Second Law of Thermodynamics
   - The second law of thermodynamics says that when energy changes from one form to another form, or matter moves freely, entropy (disorder) in a closed system increases. Differences in temperature, pressure, and density tend to even out horizontally after a while.
   
11. Fossil Fuels 
   - Formed from the fossilized remains of once-living organisms.

12. Seams
   - Long continuous deposits where coal is found.
   - The seams represent areas where large amounts of plant remains were buried and eventually transformed into coal.
   
13. Exploratory Wells
   - Predicted areas of where a sample will be.

14. Proven Reserve
   - If an exploratory reserve hits a fossil fuel reserve, it can provide an estimate of the amount of fuel that can be obtained from that area; this is called a proven reserve. 

15. Hubbert Peak  
   - The theory that the end of oil is cheap and easily available form of energy is the near future and that we must begin to develop alternative fuel sources. 
   - He was late M. King Hubbert. 
   
16. Crude Oil
   - When Oil is pumped up fresh from a reserve, it is called Crude Oil. 
   
17. Peak Production
   - The point in time when the pressure in a well drops and its rate of crude oil production starts to decline.

18. Refining
   - Complex process in which crude oil is heated and vaporized in giant columns and separated, by use of varying boiling points, into various products such as gasoline, heating oil, and asphalt.
  
19. Petrochemicals
   - Chemicals obtained by refining (distilling) crude oil. They are used as raw materials in manufacturing most industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides, plastics, synthetic fibers, paints, medicines, and many other products.
