Vocabulary
1. Energy
   - Capacity to Do Work
   
2. Potential Energy 
   - Energy at rest (stored energy)
   
3. Kinetic Energy 
   - Energy in motion
   
4. Radiant Energy
   - Sunlight  
   - Form of energy than can travel through empty space.
   
5. Convection  
   - Transfer of heat by the movement of energy around Earth (describes the movement of energy around Earth).
   
6. Conduction  
   - Transfer of energy through matter from particle to particle (describes the movement of energy around Earth).
   
7. Energy Quality 
   - High quality energy means electrical energy, mechanical energy, and some forms of chemical stored energy, for example, the fossil fuels. Low quality energy means low temperature heat. High quality energy is more valuable than low quality energy. As such, coal produces more energy than wood. 
   
8. Net Energy Yield
   - It refers to the comparison between the cost of extraction, processing, transportation, and the amount of useful energy derived from the fuel. 
   - Amount of energy available from a resource - amount of energy needed to make it available. 

9. First Law of Thermodynamics 
   - Energy can neither be created nor destroyed.

10. Second Law of Thermodynamics
   - The second law of thermodynamics says that when energy changes from one form to another form, or matter moves freely, entropy (disorder) in a closed system increases. Differences in temperature, pressure, and density tend to even out horizontally after a while.
   
11. Fossil Fuels 
   - Formed from the fossilized remains of once-living organisms.

12. Seams
   - Long continuous deposits where coal is found.
   - The seams represent areas where large amounts of plant remains were buried and eventually transformed into coal.
   
13. Exploratory Wells
   - Predicted areas of where a sample will be.

14. Proven Reserve
   - If an exploratory reserve hits a fossil fuel reserve, it can provide an estimate of the amount of fuel that can be obtained from that area; this is called a proven reserve.
