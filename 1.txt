Mesopotamia
* Gilgamesh
   * Fifth King of the city of Uruk (ruled about 2570 B.C.E - period of 126 years)
   * Central figure in a cycle of stories known as the Epic of Gilgamesh
      * Folklore and Mythology
   * Adventures of this hero and his cherished friend Enkidu
      * They killed an evil monster, rescued Uruk from a ravaging bull, and matched wits with the gods. In spite of their heroic deeds, Enkidu Offended the gods and fell under a sentence of death.
      * Gilgamesh searched for immortality, nearly found it but a snake took it away. He realized death is the ultimate faith of all living beings.
* Earliest urban societies so far have started in the fourth millennium B.C.E (4000 - 3000 B.C.E) in Mesopotamia.
   * In this agricultural society, people recognized political authorities and built states throughout Mesopotamia.
   * Social classes + Fostered labor = Production of high-quality goods for trade -> Mesopotamians invented a system of writing and supported organized religions.
   * Numerous migrants (ancient hebrews), who adopted Mesopotamian ways.
      * Phoenicians (merchants) built extensive maritime trade networks that linked South West Asia with lands throughout the Mediterranean basin.
      * Mesopotamian Inventions:
         *  Wheels and Metallurgy
Quest For Order
[Mesopotamia = “Land between two rivers”]
* Fertile valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in modern-day Iraq
   * Mesopotamia receives little rainfall BUT the Tigris and Euphrates brought huge amounts of freshwater into the region.
   * Tapping rivers + Building reservoirs + digging canals = barley, wheat and peas.
   * Small-scale irrigation began in 6000 B.C.E
      * Artificial Irrigation = Increased food supplies -> Increasing human population + more migrants
      * Human numbers increased in Sumer (southern part of Mesopotamia)
         * Sumerians may have already inhabited the land in 6000 B.C.E or they were migrants
            * By about 5000 B.C.E, they were constructing elaborate irrigation networks
            * Population of sumer reached 100,000 (dominant people of Mesopotamia)
         * Sumer also attracted migrants
            * Semintic people
               * Spoke Akkadian, Aramic, Hebrew, and Phoenician.
               * Nomadic herders who went to Mesopotamia from the Arabain and Syrian deserts to the south and west.
               * Often intermarried sumerians and adopted to sumerian ways
         * 4000 B.C.E Sumerians build 1st world cities
            * Cities = centers of political and military authority (jurisdiction extended into surrounding areas).
            * Ex: Eridu, Ur, Uruk, Lagash, Nippur, Kish and others = dominated public affairs.
            * Palaces, temples, and defense walls
            * Ziggurats (temples that reached god) 
               * In 3200 B.C.E, a massive ziggurat and temple complex was built for Goddess Inanna [Uruk’.
            * Internal & External Problems
               * Wealth stolen = Military forces securing it
            * Politics
               * By about 3000 B.C.E all cities had kings - who ruled in cooperation with local nobles (ranks of military).
[Course of the Empire]
* 2800 B.C.E -> Conflicts between city-states led to war        
   * King of Kish extended his rule to much of southern Mesopotamia. Gilgamesh later liberated Uruk from Kish’s control.
   * After 2350 B.C.E, Mesopotamia fell under the control of many powerful empires.
* Sargon (2370-2315 B.C.E) was a talented administrator and military officer
   * Served as minister to the king, and then later arranged a coup and became king.
   * About 2334 B.C.E -> He conquered the cities one by one, destroyed their defensive walls, and placed them under his governors or administrators.
   * When he visited the cities he conquered, the cities had to give food and shelter to his armies. This was sad for the cities.
   * By about 2150 B.C.E his empire had collapsed
      * Weakened due to chronic rebellion in the city-states and invasion of people who wanted the wealth.
* Hammurabi & Babylonian Empire
   * Bablylonian Hammurabi (1792 - 1750 B.C.E) = “king of the four quarters of the world”
      * His Babylonian empire dominated Mesopotamia until 1600 B.C.E
         * Improved on Sargon’s administrative techniques by relying on centralized bureaucracy and regular taxation.
         * Instead of traveling from city to city (he ruled from Babylon)
         * Less ruinous but more regular taxes
      * Hammurabi Laws
         * High standards of behavior and stern punishments for violators.
            * Death penalties for murder, theft, fraud, false accusations, sheltering of runaway slaves, failure to obey royal orders, adultery, and incest.
            * Nobles had less severe punishments than those on the lower of the social class system.
   * 1595 B.C.E -> Babylonian Empire crumbled 
      * Wealth of the empire attracted invaders (Hittities)
[Later Mesopotamian Empires]
* Assyrian Empire
   * Asyrians = hardy people from northern Mesopotamia
   * Assyrians built flourishing cities at Assur and Nineveh.
      * Professional officers
      * Chariots + archers = devastating
   * After about 3000 B.C.E, Assyrians gradually extended their authority over much of South West Asia.
      * High point = 8th and 7th centuries
      * Also Syria, Palestine, much of Anatolia, and much of Egypt (not in Mesopotamia).
      * King Assurbanipal (668-627 B.C.E) did all this
   * Library of diplomatic correspondence, administrative techniques, and scholarly texts have survived to this day (Including Epic of Gilgamesh)
   * Internal unrest and external assault brought it down in 612 B.C.E
* Nebuchadnezzar & New Babylonian Empire
   * From 600 - 550 B.C.E Babylon once again dominated Mesopotamia. 
   * King Nebuchadnezzar (605-562 B.C.E) lavished wealth and resources in the capital city.
      * Very good defensive techniques
   * Foreign conquerors won due to better weapons...THE END
