Ways to Produce Electricity (Nonrenewable, Renewable...)

<br><h3>How is Electricity Produced? </h3>
Steps on how Electricity is produced:
<ul> 
<li>An energy source provides the power that heats up the water, transforming it into steam, which then turns a turbine. Hence, the turbine converts kinetic energy (from the stream) into mechanical energy (the spinning of the turbine).</li>
<li> Now, the generator consists of copper wire coils and magnets, one of which is stationary (stator) and the other of which rotates (rotor).</li>
<li>As the turbine spins, it causes the magnets in the generator to pass over the wire coils (or vice versa), generating a flow of electrons through the copper wire and thus producing an alternating current that passes into electrical transmission lines.</li>
<li> In lieu of stream, flowing water or wind can also provide the power needed to turn the turbine and produce electricity. </li>
</ul>
How do the sources impact?
<ul>
<li> Fossil Fuels (65 % of world's electricity)</li>
<li> Nuclear Energy (20% of world's electricity) </li>
<li> Renewable Energy (15% of world's electricity)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fossil Fuels </h3>
Fast facts:
<ul>
<li> Fossil fuels, as the name indicates, are formed from the fossilized remains of once-living organisms. Over vast tracts of time, this organic matter was exposed to intense heat and pressure. Eventually, these forces broke down the organic molecules into oil, coal, and natural gas.</li>
<li>33% of global energy production comes from oil -> next is coal -> and next is natural gas. </li>
<li> Petroleum and Coal have different origins. Petroleum used today was formed from ancient marine organisms. Coal was formed from the organisms in ancient swamps.</li>
<li>Oil, or petroleum = long chain of hydrocarbons. This is found deep in the earth under both land and ocean floor, where they are stored in the pores (spaces) between rocks.  </li>
<li> Coal = mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and other atoms. Found in long continuous deposits, called seams.</li>
<li> Natural Gas = mostly of methane gas (CH4) and other gases. This is found deep in the earth under both land and ocean floor, where they are stored in the pores (spaces) between rocks. </li>

</ul>
How much fossil fuel is left?
<ul> 
<li> United States uses the most petroleum. Followed by China, Japan, India, and Russia. </li>
<li> Hubbert Peak </li>
- The theory that the end of oil is cheap and easily available form of energy is the near future and that we must begin to develop alternative fuel sources. 
- He was late M. King Hubbert.
