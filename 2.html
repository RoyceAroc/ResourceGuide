Ways to Produce Electricity (Nonrenewable, Renewable...)

<br><h3>How is Electricity Produced? </h3>
Steps on how Electricity is produced:
<ul> 
<li>An energy source provides the power that heats up the water, transforming it into steam, which then turns a turbine. Hence, the turbine converts kinetic energy (from the stream) into mechanical energy (the spinning of the turbine).</li>
<li> Now, the generator consists of copper wire coils and magnets, one of which is stationary (stator) and the other of which rotates (rotor).</li>
<li>As the turbine spins, it causes the magnets in the generator to pass over the wire coils (or vice versa), generating a flow of electrons through the copper wire and thus producing an alternating current that passes into electrical transmission lines.</li>
<li> In lieu of stream, flowing water or wind can also provide the power needed to turn the turbine and produce electricity. </li>
</ul>
How do the sources impact?
<ul>
<li> Fossil Fuels (65 % of world's electricity)</li>
<li> Nuclear Energy (20% of world's electricity) </li>
<li> Renewable Energy (15% of world's electricity)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fossil Fuels </h3>
Fast facts:
<ul>
<li> Fossil fuels, as the name indicates, are formed from the fossilized remains of once-living organisms. Over vast tracts of time, this organic matter was exposed to intense heat and pressure. Eventually, these forces broke down the organic molecules into oil, coal, and natural gas.</li>
<li>33% of global energy production comes from oil -> next is coal -> and next is natural gas. </li>

<li> Petroleum and Coal have different origins. Petroleum used today was formed from ancient marine organisms. Coal was formed from the organisms in ancient swamps.</li>
<li>Oil, or petroleum = long chain of hydrocarbons. This is found deep in the earth under both land and ocean floor, where they are stored in the pores (spaces) between rocks.  </li>
<li> Coal = mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and other atoms. Found in long continuous deposits, called seams.</li>
<li> Natural Gas = mostly of methane gas (CH4) and other gases. This is found deep in the earth under both land and ocean floor, where they are stored in the pores (spaces) between rocks. </li>

</ul>
How much fossil fuel is left?
<ul> 
<li> United States uses the most petroleum. Followed by China, Japan, India, and Russia. </li>
<li> Hubbert Peak </li>
- The theory that the end of oil is cheap and easily available form of energy is the near future and that we must begin to develop alternative fuel sources. 
- He was late M. King Hubbert.

<p id="1">Oil</p>
Crude oil, or petroleum, is a black, gooey liquid consisting mostly of a mix of different combustible hydrocarbons along with small amounts of sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen impurities. It is also known as <u>conventional or light crude oil</u>. It was formed from the decayed remains of ancient organisms that were crushed beneath layers of rock for millions of years. The resulting liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons migrated upward through porous rock layers to collect as deposits of oil and natural gas, often trapped together beneath layers of impermeable rock.
<br><br>
Three different methods of extracting Oil:<br>
1. In primary production, the oil can easily be pumped to the surface. When some oil wells are tapped for the first time, there is a large release of oil and gas, a gusher, due to pressure in the reserve. 
<br>
2. When the oil is harder to extract, people rely on pressure extraction, which uses mud, saltwater and even CO2 to push out the oil from the reserve.
<br>
3. The final method utilizes steam, hot water, or hot gases to partially melt very thick crude oil and make it easier to extract. <br>

The image above shows horizontal drilling, a method of drilling first vertically to a certain point, then bending the flexible well bore and drilling horizontally. This method is used to gain greater access to oil and gas deposits located within layers of shale or other rock deposits. Usually, wells are drilled vertically for 1.6–2.4 kilometers (1–1.5 miles) or more and then horizontally for up to 1.6 kilometers (1 mile). Two or three horizontally drilled wells can often produce as much oil as 20 vertical wells, which reduces the area of land damaged by drilling operations. This is also known as Fracking.<br>
<br>Environmental Damages Caused By Oil:
<ul> 
<li> Drilling for oil is only moderately damaging to the environment because little land is needed to drill.</li>
<li> However, when oil is transported thousands of miles by tankers, pipelines, and trucks, a lot of environmental damage can occur during transportation.</li>
<li> Climate change due to Greenhouse gases CO2 in the atmosphere. Currently, burning oil, mostly as gasoline and diesel fuel for transportation, accounts for 43% of global CO2 emissions, which have been increasing rapidly.</li>
<li> Catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 </li>
